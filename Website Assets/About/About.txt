We are Fairfield’s 
premier investment group.

Mission Statement
Fairfield Investment Group is Fairfield University's premier student-run fund.  As a group we are eager to learn about the various dynamics of the financial markets. We spend time discussing the linkages in the economy, impact of major market players, central bank policy, and other current events affecting financial markets.  We look to provide students with a unique opportunity outside of the classroom to research and pitch investments across asset classes. We seek to teach our members how to become investors through hands on portfolio management and educational resources.

Our Vision
Fairfield Investment Group started with a small group of ten students and has grown exponentially in the past 10 years, we hope to continue this growth trend in years to come. We plan to remain the premier student-run fund on campus and to attract new members that share a passion for investing.  In regards to performance, we are looking to generate returns greater than our benchmark while managing our risk efficiently. Through growing and fostering our alumni connections we aspire to create new opportunities for our future members.

Our Fund
Fairfield Investment group is a student-run, actively managed fund with about $200,000 of assets under management. The long-only fund looks to take advantage of opportunity in the market through investments in equities, ETFs, fixed income instruments, and other assets. Returns are bench-marked against the S&P 500. The group consists of a president, vice president, portfolio managers, and analysts. Investment ideas are pitched by groups of analysts that are guided by a portfolio manager; all members weigh in on investment decisions. 

Development
​Members of Fairfield Investment Group attend weekly meetings that consist of discussion of current market conditions, major market players, linkages of the economy, and opportunity for investments. Each member contributes to strategy development and prepares investment pitches throughout their involvement with the group. Through educational presentations and collaboration, the group looks to aid in development of all members. This environment and hands-on experience is designed to prepare members for their unique paths in the industry.
